# amaraldavies_l_FIP

For the FIP, the theme chosen was my friend's business which sells crystals, candles, room sprays, and crystal keychains. The project involved designing, creating assets such as logos and taking 10 of our own pictures as well as editing them and making them specific sizes. The students were able to change the wireframe although the structure should remain the same. For this project the wireframe is very similar with minor changes in sizing and positioning of the logo and menu. 

The design goal for this website was one that was simplistic, minimalistic, very clean and professional looking while still having some playful elements and colours. The colour sceheme for this website consists of a muted yellow, a dark purple, a light purple, grays for text and body copy, as well as a graay-blue to break up the spaces and add some more visual interest. The look and feel of this website should be pleasing to the eye while still remaining friendly and slighlty casual as it is an affordable and handmade business. 

The objective was to showcase these products at their best, create a memorable, pleasing, and cohesive user experience as well as using html and css to their best advantages without any signigicant error or warnings.  

I designed two desktop pages: one for the home page and one for the proudcts page as well as the mobile version of them. After designing these 4 pages, they were developed with html and then css was added for styling. Some UX/UI enchancements were added such as hover animation, :active:, cursor changes, ::before::, and ::after:: for a more friendly and interactive user experience.

Code, design, and editing were used to the best of my abilities which I believe to have resulted in a sucessful final integrated project.
